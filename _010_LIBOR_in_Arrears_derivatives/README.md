# LIBOR-in-Arrears Derivative Pricing

**Project 10: Analytical, Monte Carlo, and Numerical Integration Pricing of LIBOR-in-Arrears Products**

This project is based on Computer Project 10. of the book The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance by Mark S. Joshi, Second Edition (2008)

This repository compares multiple pricing approaches for **LIBOR-in-arrears** derivatives — instruments where the floating rate (LIBOR) is set and paid at maturity of the FRAs, swaps, swaptions, caplets.

The project implements and benchmarks:

1. **Analytical approximation** 
2. **Monte Carlo simulation** 
3. **Alternative numerical integration pricer**

The focus is on accuracy and convergence.
